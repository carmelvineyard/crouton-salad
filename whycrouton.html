    <h2>Because it's dull, you twit- it'll hurt more!</h2>
    <p>Just kidding. My oldest child introduced me to the gem known as <a href = "http://crouton.net">crouton.net</a>
        some time ago. In an age where few things are dependable, crouton.net has been the most pure and dependable
        thing on the internet. All one needs to do is to ask the internet for a crouton and crouton.net will deliver. 
        Just a crouton, nothing more, nothing less. </p>

      <p>Needless to say, as I began coding the Crouton became my subject of choice for things like mock social media pages and tribute sites.
        It was only a matter of time before a late night conversation with my oldest generated a new idea. <strong>Evil Crouton</strong> may have been the first.
        Soon we had an entire list of different versions of the Crouton. Most could be quickly coded, so we spent a couple of afternoons
        making quick pages, troubleshooting methods of doing other tasks, and altering the Crouton just a bit. A couple ideas were put aside for later and the Crouton Clicker was made simpler.
      </p>

        <p>The idea was to make our tribute in the spirit of crouton.net- as simple as possible. With few exceptions, the pages are simple, minimal, retro. There is almost no styling to speak of and that is on purpose. The focus here is on the Crouton.</p>
        <p>However, when one is making a page for an Evil Crouton, it is very tempting to make the most evil webpage possible. Resisting that was more than we could bear- but at least the audio has controls?</p>
